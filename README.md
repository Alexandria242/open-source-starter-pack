The next step is to clone the repository to your machine. Navigate to your GitHub account, open the repository your forked, and click on the clone button. You should now see a clipboard icon, clicking this copies the repository to your clipboard.

Navigate to your terminal and execute the following command:
```
git clone "url-you-just-copied"
```
Where "url-you-just-copied" (without using quotation marks) is the url to your forked repository. Refer to previous steps if you lose the url.

Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-account/open-source-starter-pack.git
```
Where "your-github-account" is your GitHub username. You are copying the contents of the open-source-starter-pack repository on GitHub to your machine.
